          <p>
            My path to UX design began with curiosity, sparked by an early
            introduction to user experience research during my university years.
            That interest led me to earn a degree in Web Design and Development
            in 2019 and a lasting focus on thoughtful, people-centered digital
            experiences. I’ve since worked as a freelance designer and as an
            onboarding project manager at a mid-sized tech company, supporting
            real customers as they navigated complex products. Those experiences
            shape how I design today: with insight, empathy, and a deep respect
            for how people actually work.

        <h3>Think</h3>
        <p>
          I journal daily as a way to reflect, notice patterns, and make sense
          of complex ideas. I started journaling at ten, and it has remained my
          most reliable way of processing information over time. Writing helps
          me slow down, connect dots, and turn experience into understanding.
        </p>
        <h3>Connect</h3>
        <p>
          Outside of work, I’m drawn to projects that turn individual effort
          into shared benefit. Recently, I started a small composting system in
          my apartment building after realizing I didn’t generate enough food
          waste on my own. I partnered with a restaurant downstairs to collect
          their scraps, manage a weekly exchange, and process everything through
          my home compost system. The finished compost goes back into the
          community—shared with friends, family, and neighbors who grow food or
          tend gardens.
        </p>
        <h3>Grow</h3>
        <p>
          In 2026, I want to explore woodworking, as learning a tactile craft
          feels like a natural extension of how I think about design. My
          grandfather was a brilliant furniture-maker, known for pieces with
          intricate carved details, and I like to think some of that curiosity
          for craft lives on in me. More than anything, this goal is about
          stepping into creative spaces with openness, trying things that once
          felt out of reach and letting new skills shape how I see and make.
