            <p class="text-lg pt-6">
              My path to UX design began with curiosity, sparked by an early introduction to user
              experience research during my university years. That interest led me to earn a degree
              in Web Design and Development in 2019 and a lasting focus on thoughtful,
              people-centered digital experiences. I’ve since worked as a freelance designer and as
              an onboarding project manager at a mid-sized tech company, supporting real customers
              as they navigated complex products. Those experiences shape how I design today: with
              insight, empathy, and a deep respect for how people actually work.

          I design human-centered UX for products people rely on every day. Drawing on experience

            I journal daily as a way to reflect, notice patterns, and make sense of complex ideas. I
            started journaling at ten, and it has remained my most reliable way of processing
            information over time. Writing helps me slow down, connect dots, and turn experience
            into understanding.

            Outside of work, I’m drawn to projects that turn individual effort into shared benefit.
            Recently, I started a small composting system in my apartment building after realizing I
            didn’t generate enough food waste on my own. I partnered with a restaurant downstairs to
            collect their scraps, manage a weekly exchange, and process everything through my home
            compost system. The finished compost goes back into the community—shared with friends,
            family, and neighbors who grow food or tend gardens.

            In 2026, I want to explore woodworking, as learning a tactile craft feels like a natural
            extension of how I think about design. My grandfather was a brilliant furniture-maker,
            known for pieces with intricate carved details, and I like to think some of that
            curiosity for craft lives on in me. More than anything, this goal is about stepping into
            creative spaces with openness, trying things that once felt out of reach and letting new
            skills shape how I see and make.
