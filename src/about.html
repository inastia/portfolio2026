            <p class="pt-6">
              My path to UX design began with curiosity, sparked by an early
              introduction to user experience research during my university
              years. That interest led me to earn a degree in Web Design and
              Development in 2019 and a lasting focus on thoughtful,
              people-centered digital experiences. I’ve since worked as a
              freelance designer and as an onboarding project manager at a
              mid-sized tech company, supporting real customers as they
              navigated complex products. Those experiences shape how I design
              today: with insight, empathy, and a deep respect for how people
              actually work.

          I design human-centered UX for products people rely on every day.
          Drawing on experience supporting and onboarding real customers, I
          focus on clarity, usability, and long-term adoption.

            I journal daily as a way to reflect, notice patterns, and make sense
            of complex ideas. I started journaling at ten, and it has remained
            my most reliable way of processing information over time. Writing
            helps me slow down, connect dots, and turn experience into
            understanding.

            Outside of work, I’m drawn to projects that turn individual effort
            into shared benefit. Recently, I started a small composting system
            in my apartment building after realizing I didn’t generate enough
            food waste on my own. I partnered with a restaurant downstairs to
            collect their scraps, manage a weekly exchange, and process
            everything through my home compost system. The finished compost goes
            back into the community—shared with friends, family, and neighbors
            who grow food or tend gardens.

            In 2026, I want to explore woodworking, as learning a tactile craft
            feels like a natural extension of how I think about design. My
            grandfather was a brilliant furniture-maker, known for pieces with
            intricate carved details, and I like to think some of that curiosity
            for craft lives on in me. More than anything, this goal is about
            stepping into creative spaces with openness, trying things that once
            felt out of reach and letting new skills shape how I see and make.
