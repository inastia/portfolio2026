              A feature addition to the Chani astrology app that lets users save
              and quickly resurface their favorite meditations, affirmations,

              <h4>Problem</h4>
              <p>
                The Chani app offers a rich library of meditations,
                affirmations, and sleep stories, but had no way to save or
                resurface audio files a user loved. Returning to a favorite
                meditation required manually searching through the entire Audio
                Library — making the experience feel more like a chore than a
                ritual.
              </p>
              <blockquote class="bg-red-100 rounded-md p-6 my-6">
                👉 I stopped using the meditation feature because I had no way
                to save the meditations that resonated with me and easily find
                them again.

              <h4>My Solution</h4>
              <p>
                I added two small but connected changes to the existing app.
                First, a heart icon on the Play Audio screen lets a user save
                any meditation while listening to it. Second, the Listen page
                was restructured using a tab pattern — Sleep Stories,
                Affirmations, Meditations — already familiar from the app's Home
                page. Any saved audio automatically surfaces at the top of its
                category, so the user never has to scan a full list to find what
                they loved.

            <h4>How Chani Solved It</h4>
            <p>
              The Chani team restructured the Listen page with two new controls
              in the header: a filter icon for browsing by category
              (Meditations, Affirmations, Sleep Stories) and a heart icon that
              leads directly to a saved-only view. Below the header, the page
              now opens with a horizontally scrolling row of favorited audio — a
              new scroll pattern in the app — followed by three category cards.
              Tapping a card leads to the full list of audio files in that
              category, where each file displays a heart icon. Favorited files
              show a filled heart; all others show an outline heart, allowing
              users to save any file directly from the list without opening it.

              <h3>Key Product Decisions</h3>
              <div class="subsection space-y-4">
                <h4>Decision 1: Solve for discoverability, not just saving</h4>
                <p>
                  The original problem was simple: users had no way to bookmark
                  an audio file. But as I mapped the user flow, a second problem
                  surfaced. Even if a user could save a file, finding it again
                  meant scrolling through three separate categories —
                  Meditations, Affirmations, and Sleep Stories — to locate it.
                  Saving without surfacing would only partially solve the
                  problem.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The solution to both came from the app's existing design. The
                  tab pattern already appeared in two places: the Home screen
                  (Today, This Week, This Year) and the Play screen (Audio,
                  Transcript). Extending that same pattern to the Listen page
                  let users switch between the three audio categories without
                  scrolling, reduced the amount of content visible at once, and
                  created a natural home for favorited files to surface at the
                  top of whichever category they belonged to. A familiar pattern
                  — no new interaction to learn, two problems resolved.

                <h4>Decision 2: Scope down to ship faster</h4>
                <p>
                  While designing the Listen page, I identified a broader
                  opportunity: the same tab pattern could simplify the Me and
                  Transits pages, which both rely on a user's birth chart and
                  would benefit from living under one umbrella — "Your Birth
                  Chart" and "Your Transits" as tabs rather than two separate
                  menu items. I developed this concept through most of the
                  design phase before pausing it deliberately.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Shipping two interconnected changes at once would delay the
                  core improvement and introduce more learning for the user at
                  the same time. A focused release — just the Listen page — gets
                  the bookmark feature into users' hands faster, lets them build
                  familiarity with the tab pattern, and creates a foundation
                  that makes future changes feel like a natural extension rather
                  than a redesign. The navigation simplification became a
                  "What's Next" rather than part of this release.

                  Retrieval in 2 taps. From the Listen page, a saved meditation
                  is reachable in two taps — selecting the Meditations tab and
                  tapping the file at the top of the list. No scrolling, no
                  scanning for a filled heart icon.

                <li>
                  Zero new interaction patterns introduced. The solution
                  extended the tab pattern already present on the Home and Play
                  screens rather than introducing a new UI convention. A user
                  who knows the app already knows how to use the feature.

                <li>
                  Two problems solved with one design decision. The tab
                  structure on the Listen page simultaneously solved category
                  navigation and favorites discoverability — two distinct
                  friction points addressed through a single, consistent
                  pattern.

                  shipped a solution to the same problem, confirming the problem
                  was real and worth prioritizing — not an edge case or personal
                  preference.

                Solving for the obvious problem often reveals a more important
                one underneath — and the better solution usually addresses both.

              <p>
                The tab pattern introduced in the Listen page opens a broader
                opportunity to simplify the app's main navigation. The Me and
                Transits pages are the only two pages in the app that draw on a
                user's birth chart specifically. Combining them under a single
                page — with "Your Birth Chart" and "Your Transits" as tabs —
                would reduce the main menu from five items to four, create a
                more intuitive home for personalized content, and extend a
                pattern users are already learning. Each release builds the
                foundation for the next one to feel native rather than new.
