         <h2>Currency exchange app</h2>
         <!-- Project details: role, timeline, tools -->
         <p></p>
         <h4>Problem</h4>
            <p>Design an app and a responsive website to help global travelers find the current exchange rates between two currencies. They can also use this information to quickly and easily exchange currencies.</p>
            <blockquote>80% of the people I interviewed prefer to exchange currency at their destination.</blockquote>
         <h4>Solution</h4>
         <p>I studied UX Design Course by Google on Coursera and built the app. I did created, planned, and conducted user interviews. I built empathy maps, a user persona, and a user flow.  </p>
         <p>I decided to create an app that allows to find the best rates for currency exchange at home as well as calculate the totals if the traveler wants to exchange currency on location.</p>

            <h4>User Research</h4>
            <p>I conducted supervised user research during low fidelity and hi fidelity phases of the design process. I did user interviews with 4 participants and based my user persona based on these four individuals. In this phase I found that most users exchange currency while at the destination location and only use Google to look up an approximate exchange rate before they leave to have an idea about their budget. </p>
            <img src="" alt="">
            <p>I created a user journey to better illustrate the difficulty many people face when they are budgeting for their trips abroad. </p>

            <h4>Empathy Map</h4>
            <p>One of the ways I tried to understand the user’s perspective was by creating an empathy map based on my interviews. I recorded and transcribed my interviews using Notes App on my computer. Then I manually added where I was speaking versus where the user was speaking. I then input the data into ChatGPT using a prompt to classify Says, Feels, Thinks, and Does for each user. ChatGPT was fairly accurate, but it made some errors. For example, it categorizes some of feelings in the Thinks section. </p>
            <img src="" alt="">
            <h4>User Flow</h4>
            <p>Upon opening the app the user will be met with a calculator page. They will want to find the currency they have if it’s not the one already set be default. Then they will search for their destination currency and input the amount they are wanting to exchange. At this point they can review the mid-market rate or input their rate of the exchange kiosk they’re at. </p>

            <h4>Sketches</h4>
            <p>The process below begins with my initial ideas for wireframes then moves to mockups and finally to high fidelity prototype. In this simple version, you can see how I approach solving the user needs. </p>
            <img src="" alt="">
            <h4>Wireframes & Prototypes</h3>
               <p>I brought my idea to an interactive digital low-fidelity prototype and tested it with five potential users to collect feedback. </p>

            <h4>Usability Study</h3>
               <p>I conducted a user texting session with 10 participants. I then took their responses through a card sorting exercise to find common themes. </p>

         <h3>Major Design Iterations</h3>
               <h4>Iteration 1. Choosing MVP over 'the perfect app'</h4>
               <h4>Iteration 2. Progress bar</h4>
         <h3>Final Design</h3>

               <h4>Product Successes</h4>
               <p></p>
               <h4>What I learned</h4>
               <p>Product feedback will always surprise and if one is open to it, it will also delight. </p>
