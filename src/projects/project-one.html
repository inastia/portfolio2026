              <p>The app includes two core experiences:</p>
              <p><b>Convert</b> – For planning ahead</p>
              <p>Displays the live mid-market rate with contextual education and refresh transparency. After entering currencies and amount, users see 4–5 ranked transfer options (lowest total cost first), including:</p>

              <p>A simplified calculator for use abroad. Users enter the exchange rate and optional service fee to instantly see the true final total.</p>
              <p>By separating research from real-time calculation, the design reduces cognitive load and makes hidden costs immediately visible.</p>

              <p>Interviewed global travelers to uncover how they research and exchange currencies. Findings highlighted decision anxiety, rate comparison across multiple apps, and frustration with hidden fees — informing the development of the core persona.</p>

            <p>After the first round, I redesigned key screens and tested the revised versions with the same participants using identical tasks. Comparing reactions helped identify where clarity improved and where friction remained.</p>
            <p>Final wireframes were completed only after validation — visual design was intentionally introduced last to ensure usability before aesthetics.</p>

          <h3>Key Product Decisions</h3>
          <div class="subsection space-y-4">
            <h4>Decision 1: Prioritizing MVP Over Feature Expansion</h4>
            <p>During interviews, users requested expanded features — such as safety ratings for exchange locations, translation support at kiosks, and nearby exchange maps.</p>
            <p>While valuable, these ideas introduced significant scope complexity. Through synthesis, I identified the core unmet need: trust in exchange rates and final totals.</p>
            <p>I intentionally narrowed the product to two essential experiences — Convert and Calculate — focusing on transparency and clarity first.</p>
            <p>Rather than building a feature-heavy ecosystem, I prioritized solving one problem exceptionally well: making the true cost of currency exchange immediately understandable.</p>
            <p>This MVP approach supports faster iteration, clearer positioning, and a stronger foundation for future expansion.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="subsection space-y-4">
            <h4>Decision 2: Replacing the Progress Bar with Stronger Defaults</h4>
            <p>After initial testing, I introduced a progress bar to clarify how many steps remained in the conversion flow.</p>
            <p>However, in the second round of testing, 3 out of 4 participants did not notice the progress indicator, and the fourth did not rely on it to complete tasks. The addition did not meaningfully improve confidence.</p>
            <p>Instead of adding navigational cues, I shifted focus to improving input clarity.</p>
            <p>Key refinements:</p>
             <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1 text-base font-light text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
              <li>Pre-selected default currencies with visible flags (replacing empty placeholders)</li>
              <li>Pre-filled the amount field with a realistic default (1,000)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Testing revealed that users respond more confidently to editable defaults than to empty inputs. A visible starting state signals what action to take next more effectively than instructional text.</p>
            <p>The final design removed the progress bar entirely and relied on stronger visual affordances instead.</p>

          <h4>What I Learned</h4>
          <p>User feedback will always challenge your assumptions.</p>
          <p>Features that seem helpful — like progress indicators or expanded functionality — don’t always solve the real problem. In this case, clarity improved not by adding more, but by simplifying inputs and strengthening default states.</p>
          <p>Testing before adding visual polish reinforced an important principle: usability must be validated before aesthetics are layered on.</p>
          <p>Most importantly, designing for financial decisions isn’t about providing more information — it’s about building trust through transparency, simplicity, and clear signals.</p>
